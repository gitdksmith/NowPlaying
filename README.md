# NowPlaying
Scrapes KUTX and Sun Radio to display what is now playing.

KUTX and Sun Radio in Austin sometimes have songs that are difficult to identify with shazam. This app scrapes the websites to show what is now playing.

You can add the song to a local library to look up later or even link you to youtube searching for that song and artist.

KUTX uses an NPR rest call to retrieve json data. This app uses the same call and extracts the song and artist fields. 
To retrieve Sun radio data we just scrape from the html page. Nothing fancy.
